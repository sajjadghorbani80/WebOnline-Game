# :video_game: Web Online Game Project
This is the second version of the number guessing game. Improvements have been made in starting, restarting and ending the game. Now you can use the start button to guess the number and if you lose the game, you can restart or end the game. Upon starting the game, a random number from 0 to 100 is generated, which you are allowed to guess up to 5 times. If you guess the number correctly, you will be shown the message of winning, otherwise, after the chance is over, it will show the message that you have lost. Also, every time you guess the wrong number, your chances decrease by one number.
